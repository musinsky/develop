In the GNU C Library, and on all POSIX systems, there is no difference between
text streams and binary streams ('b' is ignored).

%d or %i are identical for printf() but different for scanf().
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf
%d and %i are synonymous for output, but are different when used with scanf for input


man scanf
The scanf() family of functions scans input like sscanf(3), but read
from a FILE. It is very difficult to use these functions correctly, and it is
preferable to read entire lines with fgets(3) or getline(3) and parse them later
with sscanf(3) or more specialized functions such as strtol(3).

Don't use !feof(file), resp. EOF
The feof() function returns nonzero if and only if the end-of-file indicator is set for stream.
If there is a read error, the loop never terminates.
Co znamena, ze nekotroluje mozny error, preto ak feof(), tak v kombinacii s ferror().

Static functions
If a function is to be called only from within the file in which it is declared,
it is appropriate to declare it as a static function. When a function is
declared static, the compiler will know to compile an object file in a way that
prevents the function from being called from code in other files.
