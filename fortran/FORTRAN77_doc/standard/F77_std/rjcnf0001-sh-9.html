9 DATA STATEMENT
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-9">9 DATA STATEMENT</a></h1>

A DATA statement is used to provide initial values for
variables, arrays, array elements, and substrings.  A DATA
statement is nonexecutable and may appear in a program
unit anywhere after the specification statements, if any.
<p>All  initially  defined  entities are defined when an
executable program begins execution.  All entities  not
initially defined, or associated with an
initially  defined entity,  are undefined at the beginning of
execution of an executable program.
<p><h2><a name="sh-9.1">9.1 Form of a DATA Statement</a></h2>
The form of a DATA statement is:
<pre>
DATA <i>nlist</i> /<i>clist</i>/ [ <i>nlist</i> /<i>clist</i>/]...</pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>nlist</i>
is a list (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-2.html#sh-2.10">2.10</a>) of variable names, array
names, array element names, substring names,
and implied-DO lists
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>clist</i>
is a list of the form:
<li> 
<i>a</i> [,<i>a</i>]...

<li>where
<i>a</i>
 is one of the forms:
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>c</i>

<br>

<i>r</i>*<i>c</i>

<li> 
<i>c</i>
is a constant or the symbolic name of a
constant
<li> 
<i>r</i>
is a nonzero, unsigned, integer constant
or the symbolic name of such a constant.
The 
<i>r</i>*<i>c</i>
 form is equivalent to 
<i>r</i>
 successive
appearances of the constant 
<i>c</i>
.
</ul>
<p><h2><a name="sh-9.2">9.2 DATA Statement Restrictions</a></h2>
Names of dummy arguments, functions, and entities in blank
common (including entities associated with an entity in
blank common) must not appear in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
.  Names
of entities in a named common block may appear in the list

<i>nlist</i>
 only within a block data subprogram.
<p>There must be the same number of items specified by each
list 
<i>nlist</i>
 and its corresponding list 
<i>clist</i>
.  There is a
one-to-one correspondence between the items specified by

<i>nlist</i>
 and the constants specified by 
<i>clist</i>
 such that the
first item of 
<i>nlist</i>
 corresponds to the first constant of

<i>clist</i>
, etc.  By this correspondence, the initial value
is established and the entity is initially defined.  If
an array name without a subscript is in the list, there
must be one constant for each element of that array.  The
ordering of array elements is determined by the array
element subscript value (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-5.html#sh-5.2.4">5.2.4</a>).
<p>The type of the 
<i>nlist</i>
 entity and the type of the
corresponding 
<i>clist</i>
 constant must agree when either is of
type character or logical.  When the 
<i>nlist</i>
 entity
is of type integer, real, double  precision, or complex, the
1corresponding 
<i>clist</i>
 constant must also be of type integer,
real, double precision, or complex; if necessary, the 
<i>clist</i>
 constant
is converted to the type of the 
<i>nlist</i>
 entity according to
the rules for arithmetic conversion (Table 4).
Note that if an 
<i>nlist</i>
 entity is of type double
precision and the 
<i>clist</i>
 constant is of type real,
the processor may supply more precision derived
from the constant than can be contained in a real datum.
<p>Any variable, array element, or substring may be initially
defined except for:
<ol>
<li>an entity that is a dummy argument,
<li>an entity in blank common, which includes an entity
associated with an entity in blank common, or
<li>a variable in a function subprogram whose name is
also the name of the function subprogram or an entry
in the function subprogram.
</ol>
<p>A variable, array element, or substring must not be initially defined
more than once in an executable program.  If two entities
are associated, only one may be initially defined in
a DATA statement in the
same executable program.
<p>Each subscript expression in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
 must be an
integer constant expression except for implied-DO-variables
as noted in 
<a href="#sh-9.3">9.3</a>.
Each substring expression in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
 must be an
integer constant expression.
<p><h2><a name="sh-9.3">9.3 Implied-DO in a DATA Statement</a></h2>
The form of an implied-DO list in a DATA statement is:
<pre>
( <i>dlist</i>, <i>i</i> = <i>m</i> ,  <i>m</i>  [,<i>m</i>  ] )
                             1    2    3</pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>dlist</i>
is a list of array element names and implied-DO
lists
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>i</i>
is the name of an integer variable, called the

<i>implied</i>-<i>DO</i>-<i>variable</i>

<li> 
<i>m</i>   <i>m</i>   <i>m</i>
                          1,  2,  3
 are each an integer constant expression,
except that the expression may contain implied-
DO-variables of other implied-DO lists that have
this implied-DO list within their ranges
</ul>
<p>The range of an implied-DO list is the list 
<i>dlist</i>
.  An
iteration count and the values of the implied-DO-variable are
established from 
<i>m</i>
                              1
, 
<i>m</i>
                              2
, and 
<i>m</i>
                              3
 exactly
as for a DO-loop (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.10">11.10</a>), except that the iteration count
must be positive.
When an implied-DO list appears in a DATA statement,
the list items in 
<i>dlist</i>
 are specified once for each
iteration of the implied-DO list with the appropriate
substitution of values for any occurrence of the
implied-DO-variable 
<i>i</i>
.
The appearance of an implied-DO-variable
name in a DATA statement does not affect the definition
status of a variable of the same name in the same program
unit.
<p>Each subscript expression in the list 
<i>dlist</i>
 must be an
integer constant expression, except that the expression
may contain implied-DO-variables of implied-DO lists that
have the subscript expression within their ranges.
<p>The following is an example of a DATA statement that
contains implied-DO lists:
<pre>
DATA (( X(J,I), I=1,J), J=1,5) / 15*0. /</pre>

<p><h2><a name="sh-9.4">9.4 Character Constant in a DATA Statement</a></h2>
An entity in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
 that corresponds to a character
constant must be of type character.
<p>If the length of the
character entity in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
 is greater than the
length  of  its  corresponding character constant, the
additional rightmost  characters  in  the  entity  are
initially defined with blank characters.
<p>If the length of the
character entity in the list 
<i>nlist</i>
 is less than the length
of its corresponding character constant, the additional
rightmost characters in the constant are ignored.
<p>Note
that initial definition of a character entity causes definition
of all of the characters in the entity, and that each
character constant initially defines exactly one variable, array
element, or substring.
