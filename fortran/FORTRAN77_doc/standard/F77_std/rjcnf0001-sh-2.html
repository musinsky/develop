2 FORTRAN TERMS AND CONCEPTS
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-2">2 FORTRAN TERMS AND CONCEPTS</a></h1>

This section introduces basic terminology and concepts,
some of which are clarified further in later sections.
Many terms and concepts of more specialized meaning are
also introduced in later sections.  The underlined words
are described here and used
throughout this standard.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.1">2.1 Sequence</a></h2>
A
<i>sequence</i>
is a set ordered by a one-to-one correspondence
with the numbers 1, 2, through 
<i>n</i>
. 
The number of elements
in the sequence is 
<i>n</i>
. 
A sequence may be empty, in which
case it contains no elements.
<p>The elements of a nonempty sequence are referred to as the
first element, second element, etc.  The 

<i>n</i>th
 element, where 
<i>n</i>

is the number of elements in the sequence, is called the
last element.  An empty sequence has no first or last
element.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.2">2.2 Syntactic Items</a></h2>
Letters, digits, and special characters of the FORTRAN
character set (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.1">3.1</a>) are used to form the syntactic items
of the FORTRAN language.  The basic syntactic items of the
FORTRAN language are constants, symbolic names, statement
labels, keywords, operators, and special characters.
<p>The form of a constant is described in Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-4.html#sh-4">4</a>.
<p>A
<i>symbolic name</i>
takes the form of a sequence of one to six letters
or digits, the first of which must be a letter.
Classification of symbolic names and restrictions on their
use are described in Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-18.html#sh-18">18</a>.
<p>A
<i>statement label</i>
takes the form of a sequence of one to
five digits, one of which must be nonzero, and is used to
identify a statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.4">3.4</a>).
<p>A
<i>keyword</i>
takes the form of a specified sequence of letters.
The keywords that are significant in the FORTRAN language
are described in Sections 7 through 16.  In many instances,
a keyword or a portion of a keyword also meets the
requirements for a symbolic name.  Whether a particular
sequence of characters identifies a keyword or a symbolic
name is implied by context.  There is no sequence of characters
that is reserved in all contexts in FORTRAN.
<p>The set of special characters is described in

<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.1.4">3.1.4</a>.  A special character may be an operator or part of
a constant or have some other special meaning.  The
interpretation is implied by context.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.3">2.3 Statements, Comments, and Lines</a></h2>
A FORTRAN
<i>statement</i>
is a sequence of syntactic items, as
described in Sections 7 through 16.  Except for assignment
and statement function statements, each  statement begins
with a keyword.  In this standard, the keyword or keywords that begin
the statement are used to identify that   statement.  For
example, a DATA statement begins with the keyword DATA.
<p>A statement is written in one or more lines, the first of which is
called an
<i>initial line</i>
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.2.2">3.2.2</a>); succeeding lines, if any,
are called
<i>continuation lines</i>
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.2.3">3.2.3</a>).
<p>There is also a line called a 
<i>comment line</i>
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.2.1">3.2.1</a>), which
is not part of any statement and is intended to provide
documentation.
<p><h3><a name="sh-2.3.1">2.3.1 Classes of Statements.</a></h3>
Each statement is classified as executable or nonexecutable
(Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-7.html#sh-7">7</a>).  Executable statements specify actions.
Nonexecutable statements describe the characteristics,
arrangement, and initial values of data; contain editing
information; specify statement functions; classify program
units; and specify entry points within subprograms.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.4">2.4 Program Units and Procedures</a></h2>
A
<i>program unit</i>
consists of a sequence of statements and
optional comment lines.  A program unit is either a main
program or a subprogram.
<p>A
<i>main program</i>
is a program unit that does not have a
FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, or BLOCK DATA statement as its first
statement; it may have a PROGRAM statement as its first
statement.
<p>A
<i>subprogram</i>
is a program unit that has a FUNCTION,
SUBROUTINE, or BLOCK DATA statement as its first statement.
A subprogram whose first statement is a FUNCTION statement
is called a
<i>function subprogram.</i>
A subprogram whose first
statement is a SUBROUTINE statement is called a 
<i>subroutine subprogram.</i>
Function subprograms and subroutine subprograms
are called
<i>procedure subprograms.</i>
A subprogram whose  first
statement is a BLOCK DATA statement is called a 
<i>block data subprogram.</i>
<p><h3><a name="sh-2.4.1">2.4.1 Procedures.</a></h3>
Subroutines (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.6">15.6</a>), external functions (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.5">15.5</a>),  statement 
functions (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.4">15.4</a>), and the intrinsic functions (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.3">15.3</a>) are
called
<i>procedures.</i>
Subroutines and external functions are
called
<i>external procedures.</i>
Function subprograms and subroutine subprograms may specify
one or more external functions and subroutines, respectively
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.7">15.7</a>).  External procedures may also
be specified by means other than FORTRAN subprograms.
<p><h3><a name="sh-2.4.2">2.4.2 Executable Program.</a></h3>
An
<i>executable program</i>
is a collection of program units
that consists of exactly one main program and any number,
including none, of subprograms and external procedures.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.5">2.5 Variable</a></h2>
A
<i>variable</i>
is an entity that has both a name and a type.
A variable name is a symbolic name of a datum.  Such a
datum may be identified, defined (
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>), and referenced (
<a href="#sh-2.12">2.12</a>).  Note
that the usage in this standard of the word "variable" is
more restricted than its normal usage, in that it does not
include array elements.
<p>The type of a variable is optionally specified
by the appearance of the
variable name in a type-statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.4">8.4</a>).  If it is not so
specified, the type of a variable is implied by the first
letter of the variable name to be integer or real (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-4.html#sh-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>),
unless the initial letter type implication is changed by
the use of an IMPLICIT statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.5">8.5</a>).
<p>At any given time during the execution of an executable
program, a variable is either defined or undefined (
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>).
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.6">2.6 Array</a></h2>
An
<i>array</i>
is a nonempty sequence of data that has a name
and a type.  The name of an array is a symbolic name.
<p><h3><a name="sh-2.6.1">2.6.1 Array Elements.</a></h3>
Each of the elements of an array is called an
<i>array element.</i>
An array name qualified by a subscript is an array element
name and identifies a particular element of the array
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-5.html#sh-5.3">5.3</a>).  Such a datum may be identified, defined (
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>), and
referenced (
<a href="#sh-2.12">2.12</a>). The number of array elements in an array  is
specified by an 
<i>array declarator</i>
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-5.html#sh-5.1">5.1</a>).
<p>An array element has a type.  The type of all array elements
within an array is the same, and is optionally specified
by the appearance of the array name in a type-statement
(
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.4">8.4</a>).  If it is not so specified, the type of an array
element is implied by the first letter of the array name
to be integer or real (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-4.html#sh-4.1.2">4.1.2</a>), unless the initial letter
type implication is changed by the use of an IMPLICIT
statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.5">8.5</a>).
<p>At any given time during the execution of an executable
program, an array element is either defined or undefined
(
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>).
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.7">2.7 Substring</a></h2>
A character datum is a nonempty sequence of characters.  A 
<i>substring</i>
is a contiguous portion of a character datum.  The form
of a substring name used to identify, define (
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>), or reference (
<a href="#sh-2.12">2.12</a>)
a substring is described in 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-5.html#sh-5.7.1">5.7.1</a>.
<p>At any given time during the execution of an executable
program, a substring is either defined or undefined (
<a href="#sh-2.11">2.11</a>).
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.8">2.8 Dummy Argument</a></h2>
A dummy argument in a procedure is either a symbolic name
or an asterisk.
A symbolic name dummy argument
identifies a variable, array, or procedure that becomes
associated (
<a href="#sh-2.14">2.14</a>) with an actual argument of each
reference (
<a href="#sh-2.12">2.12</a>) to the procedure (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.2">15.2</a>, 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.4.2">15.4.2</a>, 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.5.2">15.5.2</a>, and 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.6.2">15.6.2</a>).
An asterisk dummy argument indicates that the corresponding
actual argument is an alternate return specifier (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.6.2.3">15.6.2.3</a>, 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.8.3">15.8.3</a>,
and 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.9.3.5">15.9.3.5</a>).
<p>Each dummy argument name that is classified as a variable, array,
or dummy procedure may appear wherever
an actual name of the same class (Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-18.html#sh-18">18</a>) and type may
appear, except where explicitly prohibited.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.9">2.9 Scope of Symbolic Names and Statement Labels</a></h2>
The scope of a symbolic name (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-18.html#sh-18.1">18.1</a>) is an executable
program, a program unit, a statement function statement,
or an implied-DO list in a DATA statement.
<p>The name of the main program and the names of block data
subprograms, external functions, subroutines, and common
blocks have a scope of an executable program.
<p>The names of variables, arrays, constants, statement
functions, intrinsic functions, and dummy procedures have
a scope of a program unit.
<p>The names of variables that appear as dummy arguments in
a statement function statement have a scope of that
statement.
<p>The names of variables that appear as the DO-variable
of an implied-DO in a DATA statement have a
scope of the implied-DO list.
<p>Statement labels have a scope of a program unit.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.10">2.10 List</a></h2>
A
<i>list</i>
is a nonempty sequence (
<a href="#sh-2.1">2.1</a>) of syntactic entities
separated by commas.  The entities in the list are called
<i>list items.</i>
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.11">2.11 Definition Status</a></h2>
At any gi
ven time during the execution of an executable
program, the
<i>definition status</i>
of each variable, array
element, or substring is either 
<i>defined</i>
or
<i>undefined</i>
(Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-17.html#sh-17">17</a>).
<p>A defined entity has a value.  The value of a defined
!entity does not change until the entity becomes undefined
or is redefined with a different value.
<p>If a variable, array element, or substring is undefined,
it does not have a predictable value.
<p>A previously defined variable or array element may become
undefined.  Subsequent definition of a defined variable
or array element is permitted, except where it is explicitly
prohibited.
<p>A character variable, character array element, or character
substring is defined if every substring of length one of
the entity is defined.  Note that if a string is defined,
every substring of the string is defined, and if any
substring of the string is undefined, the string is
undefined.  Defining any substring does not cause any other
string or substring to become undefined.
<p>An entity is
<i>initially defined</i>
if it is assigned a value
in a DATA statement (Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-9.html#sh-9">9</a>).  Initially defined entities
are in the defined state at the beginning of execution of
an executable program.  All variables and array elements
not initially defined, or associated (
<a href="#sh-2.14">2.14</a>) with an
initially defined entity, are undefined at the beginning of
execution of an executable program.
<p>An entity must be defined at the time a reference to it
is executed.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.12">2.12 Reference</a></h2>
A variable, array element, or substring 
<i>reference</i>
is the
appearance of a variable, array element, or substring name,
respectively, in a statement in a context requiring the
value of that entity to be used during the execution of the executable
program.  When a reference to an entity is executed, its
current value is available.  In this standard, the act of
defining an entity is not considered a reference to that
entity.
<p>A procedure reference is the appearance of a procedure
name in a statement in a context that requires the actions
specified by the procedure to be executed during the execution of the
executable program.  When a procedure reference is executed,
the procedure must be available.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.13">2.13 Storage</a></h2>
A
<i>storage sequence</i>
is a sequence of storage units.  A
<i>storage unit</i>
is either a numeric storage unit or a character
storage unit.
<p>An integer, real, or logical datum has one 
<i>numeric storage unit</i>
in a storage sequence. A double precision or complex
datum has two numeric storage units in a storage sequence.
A character datum has one 
<i>character storage unit</i>
in a
storage sequence for each character in the datum.  This
standard does not specify a relationship between a numeric
storage unit and a character storage unit.
<p>If a datum requires more than one storage unit in a storage
sequence, those storage units are consecutive.
<p>The concept of a storage sequence is used to describe
relationships that exist among variables, array elements,
arrays, substrings, and common blocks.  This standard does
not specify a relationship between the storage sequence
concept and the physical properties or implementation of
storage.
<p><h2><a name="sh-2.14">2.14 Association</a></h2>

<i>Association</i>
of entities exists if the same datum may be
identified by different symbolic names in the same program
unit, or by the same name or a different name in different
program units of the same executable program (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-17.html#sh-17.1">17.1</a>).
<p>Entities may become associated by the following:
<ol>
<li>Common association (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.3.4">8.3.4</a>)
<li>Equivalence association (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.2.2">8.2.2</a>)
<li>Argument association (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.9.3">15.9.3</a>)
<li>Entry association (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.7.3">15.7.3</a>)
</ol>
