10 ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-10">10 ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS</a></h1>

Completion of execution of an
assignment statement causes definition of an entity.
<p>There are four kinds of assignment statements:
<ol>
<li>Arithmetic
<li>Logical
<li>Statement label (ASSIGN)
<li>Character
</ol>
<p><h2><a name="sh-10.1">10.1 Arithmetic Assignment Statement</a></h2>
The form of an arithmetic assignment statement is:
<pre>
<i>v</i> = <i>e</i></pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>v</i>
is the name of a variable or array element of
type integer, real, double precision, or complex
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>e</i>
is an arithmetic expression
</ul>
<p>Execution of an arithmetic assignment statement causes the evaluation of the
expression 
<i>e</i>
 by the rules in Section 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-6.html#sh-6">6</a>, conversion of 
<i>e</i>

to the type of 
<i>v</i>
, and definition and assignment of 
<i>v</i>

with the resulting value, as established by the rules in Table 4.

              | Type of <i>v</i>       |  Value   |

              |                 |          |
              | Integer         |  INT(<i>e</i>)  |
              |_________________<i>|</i>__________<i>|</i>
              |                 |          |
              |_<i>Real</i>____________<i>|</i>__<i>REAL(</i><i>e</i><i>)</i>_<i>|</i>
              |                 |          |
              | Double precision|  DBLE(<i>e</i>) |
              |_________________<i>|</i>__________<i>|</i>
              |                 |          |
              <b>|</b>_<i>Complex</i>_________<i><b>|</b></i>__<i>CMPLX(</i><i>e</i><i>)</i><i><b>|</b></i>
</pre>

<p>The functions in the "Value Assigned" column of Table 4 are
generic functions described in Table 5 (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.10">15.10</a>).
<p><h2><a name="sh-10.2">10.2 Logical Assignment Statement</a></h2>
The form of a logical assignment statement is:
<pre>
<i>v</i> = <i>e</i></pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>v</i>
is the name of a logical variable or logical
array element
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>e</i>
is a logical expression
</ul>
<p>Execution of a logical assignment
statement causes the evaluation of the logical expression

<i>e</i>
 and the assignment and definition of 
<i>v</i>
 with the value
of 
<i>e</i>
.  Note that 
<i>e</i>
 must have a value of either true or false.
<p><h2><a name="sh-10.3">10.3 Statement Label Assignment (ASSIGN) Statement</a></h2>
The form of a statement label assignment statement is:
<pre>
ASSIGN <i>s</i> TO <i>i</i></pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>s</i>
is a statement label
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>i</i>
is an integer variable name
</ul>
<p>Execution of an ASSIGN statement causes the statement label 
<i>s</i>
 to be assigned to
the integer variable 
<i>i</i>
.
The statement label must be the label of a statement
that appears
in the same program unit as the ASSIGN statement.
The statement label must
be the label of an executable statement or a FORMAT statement.
<p>Execution of a statement label assignment statement is the
only way that a variable may be defined with a statement
label value.
<p>A variable must be defined with a statement label value when
referenced in an assigned GO TO statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-11.html#sh-11.3">11.3</a>) or as a format
identifier (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-12.html#sh-12.4">12.4</a>) in an input/output statement.
While defined with a statement label value, the variable must not
be referenced in any other way.
<p>An integer variable defined with a statement label value may
be redefined with the same or a different statement
label value or an integer value.
<p><h2><a name="sh-10.4">10.4 Character Assignment Statement</a></h2>
The form of a character assignment statement is:
<pre>
<i>v</i> = <i>e</i></pre>

<ul>
<li> where: 
<i>v</i>
is the name of a character variable, character
array element, or character substring
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<i>e</i>
is a character expression
</ul>
<p>Execution of a character assignment statement causes the evaluation of the
expression 
<i>e</i>
 and the assignment and definition of 
<i>v</i>
 with the value of 
<i>e</i>
.
None of the character positions
being defined in 
<i>v</i>
 may be referenced in 
<i>e</i>
.

<i>v</i>
 and 
<i>e</i>
 may have
different lengths.  If the length of 
<i>v</i>
 is greater than the length of 
<i>e</i>
,
the effect is as though 
<i>e</i>
 were extended to the right with
blank characters until it is the same length as

<i>v</i>
 and then assigned.
If the length of 
<i>v</i>
 is less than the length of 
<i>e</i>
,
the effect is as though 
<i>e</i>
 were
truncated from the right until it is the same length as 
<i>v</i>
 and
then assigned.
<p>Only as much of the value of 
<i>e</i>
 must be defined as is
needed to define 
<i>v</i>
.  In the example:
<ol>
<li> CHARACTER A*2,B*4
<li> A=B
</ol>
<p>the assignment A=B requires that the substring B(1:2)
be defined.
It does not require that the substring B(3:4) be defined.
<p>If 
<i>v</i>
 is a substring, 
<i>e</i>
 is assigned only to the substring.
The definition status of substrings not specified by 
<i>v</i>

is unchanged.
