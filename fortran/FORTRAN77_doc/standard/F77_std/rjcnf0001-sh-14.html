14 MAIN PROGRAM
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-14">14 MAIN PROGRAM</a></h1>

A
<i>main program</i>
is a program unit that does not have a
FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, or BLOCK DATA statement as its first
statement. It may have a PROGRAM statement as its first
statement.
<p>There must be exactly one main program in an executable program.
Execution of an executable program begins with the execution
of the first executable statement of the main program.
<p><h2><a name="sh-14.1">14.1 PROGRAM Statement</a></h2>
The form of a PROGRAM statement is:
<pre>
PROGRAM <i>pgm</i></pre>

where 
<i>pgm</i>
 is the symbolic name of the main program in
which the PROGRAM statement appears.
<p>A PROGRAM statement is not required to appear in an executable
program.
If it does appear, it must be the first statement of the main
program.
<p>The symbolic name 
<i>pgm</i>
 is global (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-18.html#sh-18.1.1">18.1.1</a>) to the executable program and
must not be the same as the name of an
external procedure, block data subprogram,
or common block in the same executable program.
The name 
<i>pgm</i>
 must not be the same as any local name in the main program.
<p><h2><a name="sh-14.2">14.2 Main Program Restrictions</a></h2>
The PROGRAM statement may appear only as the first
statement of a main program.
A main program may contain any other statement except a BLOCK DATA,
FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, ENTRY,  or RETURN statement.
The appearance of a SAVE statement in a main
program has no effect.
<p>A main program may not be referenced
from a subprogram or from itself.
