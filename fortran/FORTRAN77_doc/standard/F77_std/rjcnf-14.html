<title>14 MAIN PROGRAM</title></head><body>

<h1><a name="sh-14">14 MAIN PROGRAM</a></h1>

A <i>main program</i> is a program unit that does not have a FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, or BLOCK DATA statement as its first statement.  It may have a PROGRAM statement as its first statement.
<p>
There must be exactly one main program in an executable program.  Execution of an executable program begins with the execution of the first executable statement of the main program.

<h2><a name="sh-14.1">14.1 PROGRAM Statement</a></h2>

The form of a PROGRAM statement is:
<p><pre>
      PROGRAM <i>pgm</i>
</pre><p>
where <i>pgm</i> is the symbolic name of the main program in which the PROGRAM statement appears.
<p>
A PROGRAM statement is not required to appear in an executable program.  If it does appear, it must be the first statement of the main program.
<p>
The symbolic name <i>pgm</i> is global (<a href="rjcnf-18.html#sh-18.1.1">18.1.1</a>) to the executable program and must not be the same as the name of an external procedure, block data subprogram, or common block in the same executable program.  The name <i>pgm</i> must not be the same as any local name in the main program.

<h2><a name="sh-14.2">14.2 Main Program Restrictions</a></h2>

The PROGRAM statement may appear only as the first statement of a main program.  A main program may contain any other statement except a BLOCK DATA, FUNCTION, SUBROUTINE, ENTRY, or RETURN statement.  The appearance of a SAVE statement in a main program has no effect.
<p>
A main program may not be referenced from a subprogram or from itself.
