17 ASSOCIATION AND DEFINITION
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-17">17 ASSOCIATION AND DEFINITION</a></h1>

<p><h2><a name="sh-17.1">17.1 Storage and Association</a></h2>
Storage sequences are used to describe relationships that
exist among variables, array elements, substrings, common
blocks, and arguments.
<p><h3><a name="sh-17.1.1">17.1.1 Storage Sequence.</a></h3>
A
<i>storage sequence</i>
is a sequence (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-2.html#sh-2.1">2.1</a>) of storage units.
The
<i>size of a storage sequence</i>
is the number of storage 
units in the storage sequence.  A
<i>storage unit</i>
is a
character storage unit or a numeric storage unit.
<p>A variable or array element of type integer, real, or
logical has a storage sequence of one numeric storage unit.
<p>A variable or array element of type double precision or
complex has a storage sequence of two numeric storage
units.  In a complex storage sequence, the real part has
the first storage unit and the imaginary part has the
second storage unit.
<p>A variable, array element, or substring of type character
has a storage sequence of character storage units.  The
number of character storage units in the storage sequence
is the length of the character entity.  The order of the
sequence corresponds to the ordering of character
positions (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-4.html#sh-4.8">4.8</a>).
<p>Each array and common block has a storage sequence (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-5.html#sh-5.2.5">5.2.5</a>
and 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.3.2">8.3.2</a>).
<p><h3><a name="sh-17.1.2">17.1.2 Association of Storage Sequences.</a></h3>
Two storage sequences 
<i>s</i>
                              1
 and 
<i>s</i>
                              2
 are
<i>associated if the ith storage unit of 
<i>s</i>
                              1
 is the same as</i>
the jth storage unit of 
<i>s</i>
                              2
.  This causes the (i+k)th
storage unit of 
<i>s</i>
                              1
 to be the same as the (j+k)th storage
unit of 
<i>s</i>
                              2
, for each integer k such that 

1 &lt;= i+k &lt;=
size of 
<i>s</i>
                              1
 and 

1 &lt;= j+k &lt;=
size of 
<i>s</i>
                              2
.
<p><h3><a name="sh-17.1.3">17.1.3 Association of Entities.</a></h3>
Two variables, array elements, or substrings are 
<i>associated</i>
if their storage sequences are associated.  Two entities
are
<i>totally associated</i>
if they have the same storage
sequence.  Two entities are
<i>partially associated</i>
if they
are associated but not totally associated.
<p>The definition status and value of an entity affects the
definition status and value of any associated entity.  An
EQUIVALENCE statement, a COMMON statement, an ENTRY
statement (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.7.3">15.7.3</a>), or a procedure reference (argument association)
may cause association of storage sequences.
<p>An EQUIVALENCE statement causes association of entities
only within one program unit, unless one of the equivalenced
entities is also in a common block (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.3">8.3</a>).
<p>Arguments and COMMON statements cause entities in one
program unit to become associated with entities in another
program unit (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-8.html#sh-8.3">8.3</a> and 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.9">15.9</a>).
Note that association between actual and dummy arguments does not
imply association of storage sequences except
when the actual argument is the name of a variable, array element,
array, or substring.
<p>In a function subprogram, an ENTRY statement causes the
entry name to become associated with the name of the
function subprogram which appears in the
FUNCTION statement.
<p>Partial association may exist only between two character
entities or between a double precision or complex entity
and an entity of type integer, real, logical, double
precision, or complex.
<p>Except for character entities, partial association may
occur only through the use of COMMON, EQUIVALENCE, or ENTRY
statements.  Partial association must not occur through
argument association, except for arguments of type
character.
<p>In the example:
<ol>
<li> REAL A(4)a,B
<li> COMPLEX C(2)
<li> DOUBLE PRECISION D
<li> EQUIVALENCE (C(2),A(2),B), (A,D)
</ol>
<p>the third storage unit of C, the second storage unit of
A, the storage unit of B, and the second storage unit of D
are specified as the same.
The storage sequences may be illustrated as:
<pre>
storage unit|    1  |   2  |    3  |   4  |   5  |
                 |  ----C(1)----|  ----C(2)----|
                         |  A(1)|  A(2)    A(3)|  A(4)|
                                |  --B--|
                         |  -----D----- <b>|</b>
</pre>

<p>A(2) and B are totally associated.  The following are
partially associated: A(1) and C(1), A(2) and C(2), A(3)
and C(2), B and C(2), A(1) and D, A(2) and D, B and D,
C(1) and D, and C(2) and D.  Note that although C(1) and
C(2) are each associated with D, C(1) and C(2) are not
associated with each other.
<p>Partial association of character entities occurs when some,
but not all, of the storage units of the entities are the
same.  In the example:
<ol>
<li> CHARACTER A*4,B*4,C*3
<li> EQUIVALENCE (A(2:3),B,C)
</ol>
<p>A, B, and C are partially associated.
<p><h2><a name="sh-17.2">17.2 Events That Cause Entities to Become Defined</a></h2>
Variables, array elements, and substrings become defined
as follows:
<ol>
<li>Execution of an arithmetic, logical, or character
assignment statement causes the entity that precedes
the equals to become defined.
<li>As execution of an input statement proceeds, each
entity that is assigned a value of its corresponding
type from the input medium becomes defined at the
time of such assignment.
<li>Execution of a DO statement causes the DO-variable
to become defined.
<li>Beginning of execution of action specified by an
implied-DO list in an input/output statement causes
the implied-DO-variable to become defined.
<li>A DATA statement causes entities to become initially
defined at the beginning of execution of an
executable program.
<li>Execution of an ASSIGN statement causes the variable
in the statement to become defined with a statement
label value.
<li>When an entity of a given type becomes defined, all
totally associated entities of the same type become
defined except that entities totally associated
with the variable in an ASSIGN statement become
undefined when the ASSIGN statement is executed.
<li>A reference to a subprogram causes a dummy argument
to become defined if the corresponding actual
argument is defined with a value that is not a
statement label value.  Note that there must be
agreement between the actual argument and the dummy
argument (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.9.3">15.9.3</a>).
<li>Execution of an input/output statement containing
an input/output status specifier causes the specified
integer variable or array element
to become defined.
<li>Execution of an INQUIRE statement causes any entity
that is assigned a value during the execution of
the statement to become defined if no error condition
exists.
<li>When a complex entity becomes defined, all partially
associated real entities become defined.
<li>When both parts of a complex entity become defined
as a result of partially associated real or complex
entities becoming defined, the complex entity becomes
defined.
<li>When all characters of a character entity become
defined, the character entity becomes defined.
</ol>
<p><h2><a name="sh-17.3">17.3 Events That Caused Entities to Become Undefined</a></h2>
Variables, array elements, and substrings become undefined
as follows:
<ol>
<li>All entities are undefined at the beginning of
execution of an executable program except those
entities initially defined by DATA statements.
<li>When an entity of a given type becomes defined, all
totally associated entities of different type become
undefined.
<li>Execution of an ASSIGN statement causes the variable
in the statement to become undefined as an integer.
Entities that are associated with
the variable become undefined.
<li>When an entity of type other than character becomes
defined, all partially associated entities become
undefined.  However, when an entity of type real
is partially associated with an entity of type
complex, the complex entity does not become undefined
when the real entity becomes defined and the real
entity does not become undefined when the complex
entity becomes defined.  When an entity of type
complex is partially associated with another entity
of type complex, definition of one entity does not
cause the other to become undefined.
<li>When the evaluation of a function causes an argument
of the function or an entity in common to become
defined and if a reference to the function appears
in an expression in which the value of the function
is not needed to determine the value of the
expression, then the argument or the entity in
common becomes undefined when the expression is
evaluated (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-6.html#sh-6.6.1">6.6.1</a>).
<li>The execution of a RETURN statement or an END
statement within a subprogram causes all entities
within the subprogram to become undefined except
for the following:
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Entities in blank common
<li>Initially defined entities that have neither
been redefined nor become undefined
<li>Entities specified by SAVE statements
<li>Entities in a named common block that appears in
the subprogram and appears in at least one other
program unit that is either directly or
indirectly referencing the subprogram
</ol>
</ol>
<li>When an error condition or end-of-file condition
occurs during execution of an input statement, all
of the  entities specified by the input list of the
statement become undefined.
<li>Execution of a direct access input statement that
specifies a record that has not been previously
written causes all of the entities specified by the
input list of the statement to become undefined.
<li>Execution of an INQUIRE statement may cause entities
to become undefined (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-12.html#sh-12.10.3">12.10.3</a>).
<li>When any character of a character entity
becomes undefined, the character entity becomes undefined.
<li>When an entity becomes undefined as a result of
conditions described in (5) through (10), all totally
associated entities become undefined and all
partially associated entities of type other than
character become undefined.
</ol>
