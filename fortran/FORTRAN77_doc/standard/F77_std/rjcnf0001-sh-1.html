<p><h1><a name="sh-1">1 INTRODUCTION</a></h1>

<p><h2><a name="sh-1.1">1.1 Purpose</a></h2>
This standard specifies the form and establishes the
interpretation of programs expressed in the FORTRAN
language.  The purpose of this standard is to promote
portability of FORTRAN programs for use on a variety of
data processing systems.
<p><h2><a name="sh-1.2">1.2 Processor</a></h2>
The combination of a data processing system and the
mechanism by which programs are transformed for use on
that data processing system is called a 
<i>processor</i>
in this standard.
<p><h2><a name="sh-1.3">1.3 Scope</a></h2>

<p><h3><a name="sh-1.3.1">1.3.1 Inclusions.</a></h3>
This standard specifies:
<ol>
<li>The form of a program written in the FORTRAN language
<li>Rules for interpreting the meaning of such a program
and its data
<li>The form of writing input data to be processed by
such a program operating on data processing systems
<li>The form of the output data resulting from the use
of such a program on data processing systems
</ol>
<p><h3><a name="sh-1.3.2">1.3.2 Exclusions.</a></h3>
This standard does not specify:
<ol>
<li>The mechanism by which programs are transformed for
use on a data processing system
<li>The method of transcription of programs or their
input or output data to or from a data processing
medium
<li>The operations required for setup and control of
the use of programs on data processing systems
<li>The results when the rules of this standard fail
to establish an interpretation
<li>The size or complexity of a program and its data
that will exceed the capacity of any specific data
processing system or the capability of a particular
processor
<li>The range or precision of numeric quantities and
the method of rounding of numeric results
<li>The physical properties of input/output records,
files, and units
<li>The physical properties and implementation of storage
</ol>
<p><h2><a name="sh-1.4">1.4 Conformance</a></h2>
The  requirements, prohibitions, and options specified in
this standard generally refer to permissible forms and
relationships for standard-conforming programs rather than
for processors.  The obvious exceptions are the optional
output forms produced by a processor, which are not under
the control of a program.  The requirements, prohibitions,
and options for a standard-conforming processor usually
must be inferred from those given for programs.
<p>An executable program (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-2.html#sh-2.4.2">2.4.2</a>) conforms to this standard
if it uses only those forms and relationships described
herein and if the executable program has an interpretation
according to this standard.  A program unit (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-2.html#sh-2.4">2.4</a>) conforms
to this standard if it can be included in an executable
program in a manner that allows the executable program to
be standard conforming.
<p>A processor conforms to this standard if it executes
standard-conforming programs in a manner that fulfills the
interpretations prescribed herein.  A standard-conforming
processor may allow additional forms and relationships
provided that such additions do not conflict with the
standard forms and relationships.  However, a standard-conforming
processor may allow additional intrinsic
functions (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-15.html#sh-15.10">15.10</a>) even though this could cause a conflict
with the name of an external function in a standard-conforming
program.  If such a conflict occurs, the
processor is permitted to use the intrinsic function unless
the name appears in an EXTERNAL statement within the program
unit.  A standard-conforming program must not use intrinsic
functions that have been added by the processor.  Note
that a standard-conforming program must not use any forms
or relationships that are prohibited by this standard, but
a standard-conforming processor may allow such forms and
relationships if they do not change the proper
interpretation of a standard-conforming program.
<p>Because a standard-conforming program may place demands
on the processor that are not within the scope of this
standard or may include standard items that are not
portable, such as external procedures defined by means
other than FORTRAN, conformance to this standard does not
ensure that a standard-conforming program will execute
consistently on all or any standard-conforming processors.
<p><h3><a name="sh-1.4.1">1.4.1 Subset Conformance.</a></h3>
This standard describes two levels of the FORTRAN language,
referred to as FORTRAN and subset FORTRAN.  FORTRAN is the
full language.  Subset FORTRAN is a subset of the full
language.
<p>An executable program conforms to the subset level of this
standard if it uses only those forms and relationships
described herein for that level and if the executable
program has an interpretation according to this standard
at that level and would have the same interpretation in
the full language.  A program unit conforms to the subset
level of this standard if it can be included in an
executable program in a manner that allows the executable
program to be standard conforming at that level.
<p>A subset level processor conforms to the subset level of
this standard if it executes subset level standard-conforming
programs in a manner that fulfills the
interpretations prescribed herein for subset FORTRAN.  A
subset level processor may include an extension that has
a form and would have an interpretation at the full level
only if the extension has the interpretation provided by
the full level.
A subset level processor may also include extensions that do not
have forms and
interpretations in the full language.
<p><h2><a name="sh-1.5">1.5 Notation Used in This Standard</a></h2>
In this standard, "must" is. to be interpreted as
a requirement; conversely, "must not" is to be
interpreted as a prohibition.
<p>In describing the form of FORTRAN statements or constructs,
the following metalanguage conventions and symbols are
used:
<ol>
<li>Special characters from the FORTRAN character set,
uppercase letters, and uppercase words are to be
written as shown, except where otherwise noted.
<li>Lowercase letters and lowercase words indicate
general entities for which specific entities must
be substituted in actual statements.  Once a given
lowercase letter or word is used in a syntactic
specification to represent an entity, all subsequent
occurrences of that letter or word represent the
same entity until that letter or word is used in
a subsequent syntactic specification to represent
a different entity.
<li>Brackets, [ ], are used to indicate optional items.
<li>An ellipsis, ...  , indicates that the preceding
optional items may appear one or more times in
succession.
<li>Blanks are used to improve readability, but unless
otherwise noted have no significance.
<li>Words or groups of words that have special
significance are underlined where their meaning is
described.  Titles and the metalanguage symbols
described in 
<a href="#sh-1.5">1.5</a>(2) are also underlined.
</ol>
<p>An example illustrates the metalanguage.  Given a
description of the form of a statement as:
<pre>
CALL <i>sub</i> [( [<i>a</i> [,<i>a</i>]...] )]</pre>

the following forms are allowed:
<ol>
<li> 
CALL <i>sub</i>

<li> 
CALL <i>sub</i> ()

<li> 
CALL <i>sub</i> (<i>a</i>)

<li> 
CALL <i>sub</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>)

<li> 
CALL <i>sub</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>)

<li> etc
</ol>
<p>When an actual statement is written, specific entities are
substituted for
<i>sub</i>
and each 
<i>a</i>
;
for example:
<pre>
CALL ABCD (X,1.0)</pre>

<p><h2><a name="sh-1.6">1.6 Subset Text</a></h2>
The section titles in the subset description are identical
to the section titles in the full language description.
<p>There are some instances in which a general situation
occurs in the full language but only a restricted case
applies to the subset.  For example, in 
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-3.html#sh-3.6">3.6</a>, the
"nonexecutable statements" that may appear between
executable statements may only be FORMAT statements in the
subset.  In most of these instances, the more general text
of the full language description has been retained in the
subset description, even though it is to be interpreted
as covering only the restricted case.
<p>To help find differences between the full and subset languages,
vertical bars have been added in the margins where
the text of the full and subset languages differ.
For example, this sentence does not appear in the subset
language text.
<p>

<pre>
