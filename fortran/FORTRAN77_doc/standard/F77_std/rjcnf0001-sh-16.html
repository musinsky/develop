16 BLOCK DATA SUBPROGRAM
</title></head><body>
<h1><a name="sh-16">16 BLOCK DATA SUBPROGRAM</a></h1>

Block data subprograms are used to provide initial values
for variables and array elements in named common blocks.
<p>A block data subprogram is a program unit that has a BLOCK
DATA statement as its first statement.  A block data
subprogram is nonexecutable.  There may be more than one
block data subprogram in an executable program.
<p><h2><a name="sh-16.1">16.1 BLOCK DATA Statement</a></h2>
The form of a BLOCK DATA statement is:
<pre>
BLOCK DATA [<i>sub</i>]</pre>

where
<i>sub</i>
is the symbolic name of the block data subprogram
in which the BLOCK DATA statement appears.
<p>The optional name
<i>sub</i>
is a global name (
<a href="rjcnf0001-sh-18.html#sh-18.1.1">18.1.1</a>) and must not
be the same as the name of an external procedure, main
program, common block, or other block data subprogram in the
same executable program.  The name
<i>sub</i>
must not be the same
as any local name in the subprogram.
<p><h2><a name="sh-16.2">16.2 Block Data Subprogram Restrictions</a></h2>
The BLOCK DATA statement must appear only as the first
statement of a block data subprogram.  The only other
statements that may appear in a block data subprogram are
IMPLICIT, PARAMETER, DIMENSION, COMMON, SAVE, EQUIVALENCE,
DATA, END, and type-statements.  Note that comment lines are
permitted.
<p>If an entity in a named common block is initially defined,
all entities having storage units in the common block
storage sequence must be specified even if they are not all
initially defined.  More than one named common block may
have entities initially defined in a single block data
subprogram.
<p>Only an entity in a named common block may be initially
defined in a block data subprogram.  Note that entities
associated with an entity in a common block are considered
to be in that common block.
<p>The same named common block may not be specified in more
than one block data subprogram in the same executable
program.
<p>There must not be more than one unnamed block data
subprogram in an executable program.
