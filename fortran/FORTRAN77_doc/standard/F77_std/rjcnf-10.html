<title>10 ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS</title></head><body>

<h1><a name="sh-10">10 ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS</a></h1>

Completion of execution of an assignment statement causes definition of an entity.
<p>
There are four kinds of assignment statements:
<p><ol>
<li>Arithmetic
<li>Logical
<li>Statement label (ASSIGN)
<li>Character
</ol>
<h2><a name="sh-10.1">10.1 Arithmetic Assignment Statement</a></h2>

The form of an arithmetic assignment statement is:
<p><pre>
      <i>v</i> = <i>e</i>
</pre><p>
where:<ul>
<li><i>v</i> is the name of a variable or array element of type integer, real, double precision, or complex
<li><i>e</i> is an arithmetic expression
</ul><p>
Execution of an arithmetic assignment statement causes the evaluation of the expression <i>e</i> by the rules in Section <a href="rjcnf-6.html#sh-6">6</a>, conversion of <i>e</i> to the type of <i>v</i>, and definition and assignment of <i>v</i> with the resulting value, as established by the rules in Table 4.

<h4 align="center">Table 4 Arithmetic Conversion and Assignment of <i>e</i> to <i>v</i></h4>
<pre>
                        _______________________________
                        |                  |<i>          </i>|
                        | Type of v        | Value<i>    </i>|
                        |                  | Assigned<i> </i>|
                        |__________________|<i>__________</i>|
                        |                  |<i>          </i>|
                        | Integer          | INT(<i>e</i>)   |
                        |__________________|<i>__________</i>|
                        |                  |<i>          </i>|
                        | Real             | REAL(<i>e</i>)  |
                        |__________________|<i>__________</i>|
                        |                  |<i>          </i>|
                        | Double precision | DBLE(<i>e</i>)  |
                        |__________________|<i>__________</i>|
                        |                  |<i>          </i>|
                        | Complex          | CMPLX(<i>e</i>) |
                        |__________________|<i>__________</i>|
</pre><p>
The functions in the "Value Assigned" column of Table 4 are generic functions described in Table 5 (<a href="rjcnf-15.html#sh-15.10">15.10</a>).

<h2><a name="sh-10.2">10.2 Logical Assignment Statement</a></h2>

The form of a logical assignment statement is:
<p><pre>
      <i>v</i> = <i>e</i>
</pre><p>
where:<ul>
<li><i>v</i> is the name of a logical variable or logical array element
<li><i>e</i> is a logical expression
</ul><p>
Execution of a logical assignment statement causes the evaluation of the logical expression <i>e</i> and the assignment and definition of <i>v</i> with the value of <i>e</i>.  Note that <i>e</i> must have a value of either true or false.

<h2><a name="sh-10.3">10.3 Statement Label Assignment (ASSIGN) Statement</a></h2>

The form of a statement label assignment statement is:
<p><pre>
      ASSIGN <i>s</i> TO <i>i</i>
</pre><p>
where:<ul>
<li><i>s</i> is a statement label
<li><i>i</i> is an integer variable name
</ul><p>
Execution of an ASSIGN statement causes the statement label <i>s</i> to be assigned to the integer variable <i>i</i>.  The statement label must be the label of a statement that appears in the same program unit as the ASSIGN statement.  The statement label must be the label of an executable statement or a FORMAT statement.
<p>
Execution of a statement label assignment statement is the only way that a variable may be defined with a statement label value.
<p>
A variable must be defined with a statement label value when referenced in an assigned GO TO statement (<a href="rjcnf-11.html#sh-11.3">11.3</a>) or as a format identifier (<a href="rjcnf-12.html#sh-12.4">12.4</a>) in an input/output statement.  While defined with a statement label value, the variable must not be referenced in any other way.
<p>
An integer variable defined with a statement label value may be redefined with the same or a different statement label value or an integer value.

<h2><a name="sh-10.4">10.4 Character Assignment Statement</a></h2>

The form of a character assignment statement is:
<p><pre>
      <i>v</i> = <i>e</i>
</pre><p>
where:<ul>
<li><i>v</i> is the name of a character variable, character array element, or character substring
<li><i>e</i> is a character expression
</ul><p>
Execution of a character assignment statement causes the evaluation of the expression <i>e</i> and the assignment and definition of <i>v</i> with the value of <i>e</i>.  None of the character positions being defined in <i>v</i> may be referenced in <i>e</i>.  <i>v</i> and <i>e</i> may have different lengths.  If the length of <i>v</i> is greater than the length of <i>e</i>, the effect is as though <i>e</i> were extended to the right with blank characters until it is the same length as <i>v</i> and then assigned.  If the length of <i>v</i> is less than the length of <i>e</i>, the effect is as though <i>e</i> were truncated from the right until it is the same length as <i>v</i> and then assigned.
<p>
Only as much of the value of <i>e</i> must be defined as is needed to define <i>v</i>.  In the example:
<p><pre>
      CHARACTER A*2,B*4
      A=B
</pre><p>
the assignment A=B requires that the substring B(1:2) be defined.
It does not require that the substring B(3:4) be defined.
<p>
If <i>v</i> is a substring, <i>e</i> is assigned only to the substring.  The definition status of substrings not specified by <i>v</i> is unchanged.
