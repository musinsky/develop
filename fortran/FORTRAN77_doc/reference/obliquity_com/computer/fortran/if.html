<h1>Branching Control Structures</h1>
<p>
Control structures alter the normal sequential flow of a statement execution.
<code>IF</code> statements allow a program to follow different paths 
depending on predefined criteria.
</p>

<h2>Logical IF</h2>
<pre>IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>) <em class="encode">statement</em></pre>
<p>
Any executable statement may appear in the <em>statement</em> except 
<code>DO</code>, <code>IF</code>, any part of a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> 
statement or <code>END</code>.
</p>
<p>
If the <em>logical-expression</em> evaluates to <code>.TRUE.</code>, then
the <em>statement</em> is executed and control passes on to the next
executable statement in the program.  However, if the 
<em>logical-expression</em> evaluates to <code>.FALSE.</code>, then the
<em>statement</em> is ignored and as before, control passes on to the next
executable statement in the program.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
      Y = 0.0
      IF (X .NE. 0.0) Y = 1.0/X
      WRITE(*,*)X,Y
</pre>
<p>
The variable <code>Y</code> is assigned the value <code>0.0</code>.  Then
a logical&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement is encountered.  If <code>X</code> 
is nonzero (supposedly <code>X</code> has been assigned a value somewhere
earlier in the program), then <code>Y</code> is assigned the value of 
<code>1.0/X</code> and both values are written out to the default output 
device.  However, if <code>X</code> is zero, then the logical 
expression <code>X&nbsp;.NE.&nbsp;0.0</code> is false.  In this instance,
the statement <code>Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.0/X</code> is skipped and control 
passes immediately to the <code>WRITE</code> statement following.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Block IF</h2>
<p>
The block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement is a more general version of the 
simple logical&nbsp;<code>IF</code> and can take several forms, depending 
on the complexity of the decisions and/or branching.
</p>

<h3>IF-THEN-END IF</h3>
<pre>
IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>) THEN
   <em class="encode">statement<sub>1</sub></em>
   <em class="encode">statement<sub>2</sub></em>
&hellip;
   <em class="encode">statement<sub>n</sub></em>
END IF
</pre>
<p>
This is the simplest form of the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.  Instead of 
a single executable statement, the word <code>THEN</code> follows the 
<em>logical-expression</em>.  Then one or more executable statements
are listed in the order they should be executed (this is the 
'statement block' which gives the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> its
name) and the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement concludes with an 
<code>END&nbsp;IF</code> statement.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
      Y = 0.0
      Z = -1.0
      IF (X .NE. 0.0) THEN
         Y = 1.0/X
         Z = X**2
      END IF
      WRITE(*,*)X,Y,Z
</pre>
<p>
Here the variable <code>Y</code> is assigned the value <code>0.0</code> and
the variable <code>Z</code> is assigned the value <code>-1.0</code>.
Then a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement is encountered.  If <code>X</code> 
is nonzero then <code>Y</code> is assigned the value of <code>1.0/X</code> and 
<code>Z</code> is assigned the value <code>X**2</code>.  Then all 
three values are written out to the default output device.  However, if 
<code>X</code> is zero, then the logical expression 
<code>X&nbsp;.NE.&nbsp;0.0</code> is false.  In this instance, the statements
inside the block are skipped and control passes immediately to the 
<code>WRITE</code> statement following the <code>END&nbsp;IF</code> statement.
</p>
</div>

<h3>IF-THEN-ELSE-END IF</h3>
<pre>
IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>) THEN
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>1</sub></em>
ELSE
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>2</sub></em>
END IF
</pre>
<p>
This slightly more complicated case allows for one statement block to be 
executed if the <em>logical-expression</em> evaluates to <code>.TRUE.</code> 
and an alternative statement block to be executed if the 
<em>logical-expression</em> is <code>.FALSE.</code>
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
Suppose <code>CREDIT</code> and <code>DEBIT</code> have been declared to be 
<code>INTEGER</code> variables and <code>TRNSCT</code> (short for 
'transaction') has been declared to be a <code>REAL</code> variable.
</p>
<pre>
      IF (TRNSCT .GE. 0.0) THEN
         CREDIT = CREDIT + 1
      ELSE
         DEBIT  = DEBIT + 1
      END IF
</pre>
<p>
Assuming that these variables have been given values earlier in the program, 
this <code>IF</code> statement tests to see if <code>TRNSCT</code> is 
non-negative.  If it is, the logical expression evaluates to 
<code>.TRUE.</code> and the variable <code>CREDIT</code> is incremented by 1.  
Otherwise, the variable <code>DEBIT</code> is incremented by 1.  Only one of 
the blocks is executed, depending on the value of the 
<em>logical-expression</em>.  Once one of the blocks has been executed, 
control transfers to the end of the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> and the 
statements following.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Note how this structure differs from the previous one.  In the 
<code>IF-THEN-END&nbsp;IF</code>, it is possible for no action to take place.
However, with an <code>IF-THEN-ELSE-END&nbsp;IF</code> structure, one of the 
blocks <strong>must</strong> be executed.
</p>

<h3>IF-THEN-ELSE&nbsp;IF-THEN-ELSE-END IF</h3>
<pre>
IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression<sub>1</sub></em>) THEN
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>1</sub></em>
ELSE IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression<sub>2</sub></em>) THEN
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>2</sub></em>
ELSE IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression<sub>3</sub></em>) THEN
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>3</sub></em>
&hellip;
ELSE
   <em class="encode">statement-block<sub>n</sub></em>
END IF
</pre>
<p>
This is the most general case, allowing for multiple decisions with an 
optional default.  Any number of <code>ELSE&nbsp;IF-THEN</code> blocks may be 
used and the final <code>ELSE</code> block is optional.  If it exists, then 
it will be executed if none of the preceding logical expressions evaluate to 
<code>.TRUE.</code>  However, if there is no <code>ELSE</code> block, then
it is entirely possible that none of the blocks in the 
block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement will be executed.  Note that if an
<code>ELSE</code> block is to be included in a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> 
statement, it must be the <strong>final</strong> block.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
The Gregorian reform of the Julian calendar during the sixteenth century 
gave us the rule we use today to determine leap years.  Years evenly 
divisible by 4 are leap years but the only centurial years (years ending 
with 00) that are leap years are those evenly divisible by 400.
</p>
<pre>
      IF (MOD(YEAR,400) .EQ. 0) THEN
         WRITE(*,*)YEAR,' is a leap year'
      ELSE IF (MOD(YEAR,100) .EQ. 0) THEN
         WRITE(*,*)YEAR,' is NOT a leap year'
      ELSE IF (MOD(YEAR,4) .EQ. 0) THEN
         WRITE(*,*)YEAR,' is a leap year'
      ELSE
         WRITE(*,*)YEAR,' is NOT a leap year'
      END IF
</pre>
<p>
This block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement is one way of testing to see if an 
<code>INTEGER</code> variable called <code>YEAR</code> is a leap year or not.
(Note that this is a very inefficient algorithm for calculating leap years!)
The <code>MOD</code> function returns the value <em>argument<sub>1</sub></em> 
modulo <em>argument<sub>2</sub></em>.  The first logical expression, 
<code>(MOD(YEAR,400)&nbsp;.EQ.&nbsp;0</code> returns <code>.TRUE.</code> if 
the year is evenly divisible by 400.  If it is, then the year followed by 
the message <code>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;leap&nbsp;year</code> is written to the 
standard output device.  If not, the second logical expression is 
evaluated.  This one tests to see if <code>YEAR</code> is evenly divisible 
by <code>100</code>.  This takes care of the other three centurial year 
cases.  The third logical expression looks for years that are evenly 
divisible by 4.  If none of the logical expressions evaluate to 
<code>.TRUE.</code>, then the <code>ELSE</code> block is executed, leaving 
us with no leap year.
</p>
</div>

<h3>General Considerations</h3>
<p>
Any executable statement may appear in the statement block except 
<code>END</code>.  In particular, another complete block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> 
or a complete <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop may appear within the statement block.
Control may pass out of the block (for instance, with a 
<code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statement) but it is illegal to transfer into the 
middle of a block.  After a block of statements has been executed, control
is passed to the next executable statement following the 
<code>END&nbsp;IF</code> statement (unless, of course, control was passed out 
of the block in some manner).
</p>
<p>
If a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement contains many branches, then the 
order in which the <code>ELSE&nbsp;IF</code> blocks occur may affect efficiency.
Place the blocks which are most likely to be executed near the top of the
block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.  Remember: the optional <code>ELSE</code> block
must always occur last.
</p>
<p>
In each of the examples, the statement blocks are indented slightly from
the left.  This is not a requirement but makes the structure of the 
program much more immediately obvious, particularly when there is deep
nesting of control structures.
</p>

<h2>Nesting</h2>
<p>
<strong>Nesting</strong> refers to the inclusion of a complete control 
structure within another control structure.  For instance, it is possible to 
place a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement within another 
block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.  The two block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statements 
do not overlap; rather, one contains the other.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
Consider this program fragment where the variables <code>A</code>, 
<code>B</code> and <code>C</code> have already been assigned values.
</p>
<pre>
      IF (A .NE. 0.0) THEN
         DISC = B**2 - 4.0*A*C
         IF (DISC .GT. 0.0) THEN
            WRITE(*,*)'The roots are real and distinct'
         ELSE IF (DISC .LT. 0.0) THEN
            WRITE(*,*)'The roots are complex conjugates'
         ELSE
            WRITE(*,*)'The roots are real and identical'
         END IF
      ELSE
         WRITE(*,*)'The equation is linear, not quadratic'
      END IF
</pre>
<p>
If <code>A</code> is non-zero, then the first statement block is 
executed.  The value for the variable <code>DISC</code> is calculated and
then another complete block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement is encountered.
The string 
<code>The&nbsp;roots&nbsp;are&nbsp;real&nbsp;and&nbsp;distinct</code> is
written out if <code>DISC</code> is positive.  If <code>DISC</code> is 
exactly zero, then 
<code>The&nbsp;roots&nbsp;are&nbsp;real&nbsp;and&nbsp;identical</code> is
written out.  However, if <code>DISC</code> is neither positive nor zero
(that is, if <code>DISC</code> is negative), then 
<code>The&nbsp;roots&nbsp;are&nbsp;complex&nbsp;conjugates</code> is
written out.  This inner or nested block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement 
then concludes within in the first statement block of the outer
block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.
</p>
<p>
If, however, <code>A</code> is zero, then the second statement block is
executed; namely, the string 
<code>The&nbsp;equation&nbsp;is&nbsp;linear,&nbsp;not&nbsp;quadratic</code> 
is written out.  The outer block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement then 
concludes.
</p>
<p>
The careful use of indentation makes nested constructs easier to see although
it has no effect on the running of the program.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is also possible to nest different types of control structures.  For 
instance, you can nest a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop within a statement block
of a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement.  Conversely, a 
<code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop can contain a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.  The
only consideration is that one structure must be fully contained within the
other.  Overlap is not allowed.
</p>

<h2>Arithmetic IF</h2>
<pre>IF (<em class="encode">arithmetic-expression</em>) <em class="encode">label<sub>-1</sub></em>, <em class="encode">label<sub>0</sub></em>, <em class="encode">label<sub>1</sub></em></pre>
<p class="bang">
This form of <code>IF</code> statement is obscure and its use is strongly 
discouraged.
</p>
<p>
It is equivalent to this block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement:
</p>
<pre>
IF (<em class="encode">arithmetic-expression</em> .LT. 0) THEN
   GO TO <em class="encode">label<sub>-1</sub></em>
ELSE IF (<em class="encode">arithmetic-expression</em> .EQ. 0) THEN
   GO TO <em class="encode">label<sub>0</sub></em>
ELSE
   GO TO <em class="encode">label<sub>1</sub></em>
END IF
</pre>
