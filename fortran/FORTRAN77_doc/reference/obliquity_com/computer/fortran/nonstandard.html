<h1>Nonstandard Statements</h1>
<p>
Different manufacturers like to add extensions to 'their' version of 
FORTRAN&nbsp;77 and a number of these extensions are widely supported.  For 
truly portable software you should avoid their use but if portability is not 
an issue, then the nonstandard statements can be very useful to the programmer.
</p>

<h2>IMPLICIT NONE Statement</h2>
<p>
In FORTRAN&nbsp;77, all constants, variables and arrays are assigned an 
implicit type according to the first letter of the symbolic name unless it 
is overridden by an explicit type declaration.  This can lead to subtle errors 
as misspelled symbolic names are not picked up by the compiler but merely 
assigned the appropriate type.  The <code>IMPLICIT&nbsp;NONE</code> 
statement at the beginning of the type declarations in a program unit turns 
off implicit typing and forces the programmer to explicitly declare the type 
of every constant, variable and array used.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
The declarations
</p>
<pre>
      IMPLICIT    NONE
      INTEGER     I,NMAX
      PARAMETER(NMAX = 5000)
      CHARACTER*3 BAYER(NMAX),CONST(NMAX)
      REAL        DEC(NMAX),RA(NMAX)
</pre>
<p>
at the beginning of a program unit define the variables named 
<code>I</code> and <code>NMAX</code> to be <code>INTEGER</code>; 
<code>BAYER</code> and <code>CONST</code> to be length 3 <code>CHARACTER</code> 
arrays of size <code>NMAX</code> (which is given a value of 5000 in a previous 
<code>PARAMETER</code> statement); and <code>DEC</code> and <code>RA</code> 
to be <code>REAL</code> arrays of size <code>NMAX</code>.  The 
<code>IMPLICIT&nbsp;NONE</code> statement means that if any other constant, 
variable or array names appear in the program unit, the compiler will return 
an error.  This is a useful guard against mistyped symbolic names.
</p>
</div>

<h2>INCLUDE Statement</h2>
<p>
The <code>INCLUDE</code> statement inserts the contents of a separate text 
file into the source code in place of the <code>INCLUDE</code> statement.
It is often used with specification statements where the same set of 
specifications, including type declarations, <code>PARAMETER</code> statements 
and <code>COMMON</code> blocks, is used in multiple program units.  The 
general form of the <code>INCLUDE</code> statement is
</p>
<pre>INCLUDE '<em class="encode">file-name</em>'</pre>

<div class="example">
<h4>Case Study</h4>
<p>
Some years ago, one of the authors wrote a FORTRAN&nbsp;77 program to model 
the structure and evolution of the Sun.  Vast amounts of data had to be 
passed between program units and the same physical constants had to be used 
over and over again.  Retyping this information in each program unit was 
highly susceptible to error so many of the type declarations, constant 
initialisations and <code>COMMON</code>&nbsp;block declarations were put in 
separate text files and <code>INCLUDE</code> statements were used where 
appropriate in the various program units.
</p>
<p>
As an example, a file called <code>physix.h</code> contained assorted physical 
constants used throughout the program.  The file contained type and 
<code>COMMON</code>&nbsp;block declarations and looked like this:
</p>
<pre>
C This common block contains physical constants in cgs units.  Our
C variables are as follows:
C A                    radiation constant
C A1-A14               atomic weights
C C                    speed of light
C CP                   specific heat at constant pressure
C FOURPI               4 pi
C G                    gravitational constant
C GAMMA                adiabatic constant
C LSUN                 luminosity of the Sun
C MSUN                 mass of the Sun
C NA                   Avogadro's number
C PI                   pi
C RATIO                (gamma - 1)/gamma
C RATIO1               gamma/(gamma - 1)
C RG                   gas constant
C RSUN                 radius of the Sun
C SECYR                seconds per year

      DOUBLE PRECISION A,A1,A3,A4,A12,A14,C,CP,FOURPI,G,GAMMA,LSUN
      DOUBLE PRECISION MSUN,NA,PI,RATIO,RATIO1,RG,RSUN,SECYR
      COMMON /PHYSIX/  A,A1,A3,A4,A12,A14,C,CP,FOURPI,G,GAMMA,LSUN,
     $                 MSUN,NA,PI,RATIO,RATIO1,RG,RSUN,SECYR
</pre>
<p>
Note that the included file must be in proper FORTRAN&nbsp;77 format.  The 
main program then contained the following statements:
</p>
<pre>
      PROGRAM MAIN
&hellip;
      IMPLICIT NONE
      INCLUDE  'coef.h'
      INCLUDE  'files.h'
      INCLUDE  'help.h'
      INCLUDE  'old.h'
      INCLUDE  'opacity.h'
      INCLUDE  'param.h'
      INCLUDE  'physix.h'
      INCLUDE  'time0.h'
&hellip;
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of the <code>IMPLICIT&nbsp;NONE</code> statement to disable 
automatic typing.  <code>INCLUDE</code> statements were used throughout the
program, including external functions and subroutines.
</p>
<p>
Why use <code>INCLUDE</code>?  It reduces error when the same block of code 
is reused in many program units.  Plus, if a change is made to that block of 
code, it is only necessary to make the change in one place, rather than 
having to hunt throughout the entire program, making the change in multiple 
places.
</p>
</div>

<h2>DO Loop</h2>
<p>
One widely supported nonstandard FORTRAN&nbsp;77 statement is 
<code>END&nbsp;DO</code> which is used in place of a labelled 
<code>CONTINUE</code> statement at the end of a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop.
The general form of such a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
      DO <em class="encode">loop-control-variable</em> = <em class="encode">initial-value</em>, <em class="encode">final-value</em>, <em class="encode">step-size</em>
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>1</sub></em>
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>2</sub></em>
&hellip;
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>n</sub></em>
      END DO
</pre>
<p>
Note that there is no label in the <code>DO</code> statement, just the 
<em>loop-control-variable</em> and its values.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
      SUM = 0
      DO I = 1,100
         SUM = SUM + I
      END DO
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to
</p>
<pre>
      SUM = 0
      DO 10, I = 1,100
         SUM = SUM + I
   10 CONTINUE
</pre>
</div>

<h2>DO WHILE Loop</h2>
<p>
A <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop works well if there is a countable number of 
iterations that must be performed but sometimes it is necessary to loop 
based on some logical criterion.  FORTRAN&nbsp;77 has no other built-in loop 
structures although it is possible to write do-while and repeat-until loops 
using <code>IF</code> and <code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statements.  However, one 
common FORTRAN&nbsp;77 extension is a formal <code>DO&nbsp;WHILTE</code> 
statement.  The general form of this statement is
</p>
<pre>
      DO WHILE (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>)
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>1</sub></em>
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>2</sub></em>
&hellip;
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>n</sub></em>
      END DO
</pre>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
      DO WHILE (A .GT. B)
         WRITE(*,*)'A = ',A,' and B = ',B
         A = A - 1
         B = B + 1
      END DO
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent to
</p>
<pre>
   10 IF (A .GT. B) THEN
         WRITE(*,*)'A = ',A,' and B = ',B
         A = A - 1
         B = B + 1
         GO TO 10
      END IF
</pre>
<p>
Note the use of the <code>END&nbsp;DO</code> statement to demarcate the end 
of the loop, just like the alternative form of the <code>DO</code> loop 
discussed above.
