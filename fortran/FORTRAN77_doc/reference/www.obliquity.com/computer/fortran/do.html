<h1>Looping Control Structures</h1>
<p>
Control structures alter the normal sequential flow of a statement execution.
Loops allow the a block of statements to be executed repeatedly without 
actually writing them down numerous times.
</p>

<h2>DO Loop</h2>
<p>
A <code>DO</code> loop allows a block of statements to be executed repeatedly.
</p>
<pre>
      DO <em class="encode">label</em>, <em class="encode">loop-control-variable</em> = <em class="encode">initial-value</em>, <em class="encode">final-value</em>, <em class="encode">step-size</em>
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>1</sub></em>
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>2</sub></em>
&hellip;
         <em class="encode">statement<sub>n</sub></em>
<em class="encode">label</em>   CONTINUE
</pre>
<p>
The <em>label</em> is any number between 1 and 99999 which is attached to
the final statement in the <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop.  This final statement
may be any executable statement but is usually a <code>CONTINUE</code>
statement.  The <code>CONTINUE</code> statement is just a dummy statement 
traditionally used at the end of a loop.
</p>
<p>
The <em>loop-control-variable</em> may be a variable (but not an array 
element) of type <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code> or 
<code>DOUBLE&nbsp;PRECISION</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>initial-value</em>, <em>final-value</em> and <em>step-size</em> 
control the number of iterations.  They may be any expression that evaluates 
to an <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>REAL</code> or 
<code>DOUBLE&nbsp;PRECISION</code>, but the <em>step-size</em> must be 
nonzero.  The <em>step-size</em> may be omitted entirely in which case it 
is taken to be 1.
</p>
<p>
The number of iterations is fixed at the beginning of the 
<code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop according to the formula
</p>
<pre>
<em class="encode">iterations</em> = MAX(0,INT((<em class="encode">final-value</em> - <em class="encode">initial-value</em> + <em class="encode">step-size</em>)/<em class="encode">step-size</em>)
</pre>
<p>
so altering the values of the <em>initial-value</em>, <em>final-value</em> 
and <em>step-size</em> inside the loop will not affect the number of times 
the loop is executed.  The <em>loop-control-variable</em> may be (and often 
is) used in statements within the loop but it may not be assigned a new value 
there.
</p>
<p>
It is possible for the number of iterations to be zero, in which case the
loop is not executed and control passes to the next executable statement 
following the labelled statement delimiting the end of the <code>DO</code> 
loop.
</p>
<p>
Upon encountering a <code>DO</code> statement, the 
<em>loop-control-variable</em> is assigned the <em>initial-value</em>.
When a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop finishes normally, the 
<em>loop-control-variable</em> contains the value of the last iteration 
(which is not necessarily the <em>final-value</em>) plus the 
<em>step-size</em>.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
Adding up the numbers between 1 and 100 is simple with a 
<code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop.  If the <em>step-size</em> is equal to 1, 
then it may be omitted from the <code>DO</code> statement.
</p>
<pre>
      SUM = 0
      DO 10, I = 1,100
         SUM = SUM + I
   10 CONTINUE
</pre>
<p>
The <em>loop-control-variable</em> <code>I</code> has the value 
<code>101</code> when the loop exits.
</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
Suppose we wish to print out only the multiples of 3 between 0 and 100.
This can be accomplished by setting the <em>initial-value</em> to 0 and 
the <em>step-size</em> to 3.
</p>
<pre>
      DO 20, I = 0,100,3
         WRITE(*,*)I
   20 CONTINUE
</pre>
<p>
Obviously, the number 100 itself is not a multiple of 3.  We could have 
used 99 as the <em>final-value</em> instead and it would have given the 
same result.  The <em>loop-control-variable</em> <code>I</code> has the value 
<code>102</code> when the loop exits.
</p>
</div>

<h3>General Considerations</h3>
<p>
As with block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statements, control may pass out of the 
loop (for instance, with a <code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statement) but it is illegal 
to transfer into the middle of a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop.  If the loop is 
exited prematurely, the <em>loop-control-variable</em> keeps the value
that it had at that point.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that rounding errors may cause unintended effects when a 
non-<code>INTEGER</code> variable is used as the 
<em>loop-control-variable</em>.  Also, the number of iterations may not be
what you expect if non-<code>INTEGER</code> values are used as the 
<em>initial-value</em>, <em>final-value</em> or <em>step-size</em>.
</p>
<p>
In each of the examples, the statement blocks are indented slightly from
the left.  This is not a requirement but makes the structure of the 
program much more immediately obvious, particularly when there is deep
nesting of control structures.
</p>

<h2>Nesting</h2>
<p>
Nesting <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loops is common, particularly when 
manipulating multi-dimensional arrays.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<p>
Consider this program fragment which performs matrix-vector multiplication:
</p>
<pre>
      DO 20, I = 1,M
         SUM = 0.0
         DO 10, J = 1,N
            SUM = SUM + MATRIX(I,J)*VECTOR(J)
   10    CONTINUE
         PRDCT(I) = SUM
   20 CONTINUE
</pre>
<p>
Note that the inner <code>DO&nbsp;10</code> loop is completely contained 
within the body of the outer <code>DO&nbsp;20</code> loop.  Indentation 
helps distinguish the nesting occurring in the code.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is also permissable to nest block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statements 
within a <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop.  Nesting is also possible with the 
loop structures described below.
</p>

<h2>do-while Loop</h2>
<p>
A <code>DO</code>&nbsp;loop iterates a fixed number of times but sometimes it
is necessary to loop based on some kind of testable criterion which does not
depend on the number of iterations.  One such loop is called a do-while loop 
which iterates zero or more times.  FORTRAN&nbsp;77 does not have a formal 
do-while loop structure but it is easy to construct one using <code>IF</code> 
and <code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statements.
</p>
<pre>
<em class="encode">label</em>   IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>) THEN
         <em class="encode">statement block</em>
         GO TO <em class="encode">label</em>
      END IF
</pre>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
   10 IF (Z .GE. 0D0) THEN
         Z = Z - SQRT(Z)
         GO TO 10
      END IF
</pre>
<p>
The statement labelled <code>10</code> is a block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.
If the value stored in the variable <code>Z</code> is non-negative, then
the statement block in the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> is executed.  In 
this case, the value of <code>Z&nbsp;-&nbsp;SQRT(Z)</code> is calculated
and assigned to the variable <code>Z</code>.  Then the 
unconditional&nbsp;<code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statement is encountered and control 
is passed out of the body of block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> and back to the 
statement labelled with the number <code>10</code> which is the beginning 
of the block&nbsp;<code>IF</code>.  This loop continues until the 
logical expression <code>Z&nbsp;.GE.&nbsp;0D0</code> is 
<code>.FALSE.</code> at which time the loop is finished and control 
passes on to the next executable statement past the <code>END&nbsp;IF</code>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
A do-while loop tests at the beginning of the loop.  If the criterion is 
not satisfied, then the program does not enter the loop.  Thus it is 
possible for the loop to be skipped completely.
</p>

<h2>repeat-until Loop</h2>
<p>
Another type of loop is the repeat-until loop.  This loop iterates one or 
more times.  Unlike the do-while loop, the repeat-until loop tests at the 
bottom of the loop so it always executes at least once.  Again, 
FORTRAN&nbsp;77 does not have a formal repeat-until loop but it is easy to 
construct one using <code>IF</code> and <code>GO&nbsp;TO</code> statements.
</p>
<pre>
<em class="encode">label</em>   CONTINUE
         <em class="encode">statement block</em>
      IF (<em class="encode">logical-expression</em>) GO TO <em class="encode">label</em>
</pre>

<div class="example">
<h4 class="printX">Example</h4>
<pre>
   10 CONTINUE
         WRITE(*,*)'Enter a value 1-12 for the month'
         READ(*,*)MONTH
      IF (MONTH .LT. 1 .OR. MONTH .GT. 12) GO TO 10
</pre>
<p>
The statement labelled <code>10</code> is a <code>CONTINUE</code> statement
which is often used at the beginning or end of a loop structure.  This 
program fragment executes the <code>CONTINUE</code> statement (which does
nothing) and then prints out the statement 
<code>Enter&nbsp;a&nbsp;value&nbsp;1-12&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;month</code>.  
The program then reads in a value from the standard input device and stores 
it in the variable <code>MONTH</code>.  At this point <code>MONTH</code> is 
tested to see if it is between the values of 1 and 12 inclusive.  If it is, 
then control passes to the next executable statement, but if it isn't, then 
the <code>GO&nbsp;TO&nbsp;10</code> statement is executed and the program 
returns to the <code>CONTINUE</code> statement.  The program then goes 
through the <code>WRITE</code> and <code>READ</code> statements again and 
tests the new value of <code>MONTH</code>.  The program will not break out 
of this loop until <code>MONTH</code> has a legal value.
