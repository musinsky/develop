<h1>Compiling and Linking</h1>
<p>
FORTRAN&nbsp;77 is a compiled language.  This means that FORTRAN&nbsp;77 
source code must be converted into the host computer's native instruction 
set, a format known as <strong>machine code</strong>.  This process is known as 
<strong>compilation</strong>.  If a program uses functions or subroutines, 
these must also be compiled into machine code.
</p>
<p>
Then the machine code for the main program plus all functions and subroutines 
which it uses must be merged into a single file, called an 
<strong>executable</strong>.  This process is known as <strong>linking</strong>.
</p>

<h2>What happens during compilation?</h2>
<p>
The FORTRAN&nbsp;77 compiler processes each <strong>source file</strong> to 
convert the FORTRAN&nbsp;77 statements into their equivalent in the low-level 
machine code for the target computer.  This is normally the computer on which 
the FORTRAN&nbsp;77 program is being compiled, but it could be a computer with 
a different type of <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>, in which 
case it is known as <strong>cross-compilation</strong>.  In either case, the 
output is a binary file called an <strong>object file</strong>.  Each source 
file is compiled into a separate object file.
</p>
<p>
The object file contains the machine code corresponding to the FORTRAN&nbsp;77 
source code, plus additional information which allows the linker to resolve 
references to functions and subroutines in other object files.
</p>
<p>
Most FORTRAN&nbsp;77 compilers generate reasonably efficient machine code by 
default, but also provide options to apply higher levels of optimisation.  This 
requires that the compiler analyse the source code in greater depth, so 
compilation is slower.  However, the resulting machine code can often be 
much more efficient, leading to programs which run more quickly.
</p>
<p>
Many compilers can also take advantage of specific features of the target 
<abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>, such as the streaming 
<abbr title="single instruction, multiple data">SIMD</abbr> extension 
instruction set of Intel and <abbr title="Advanced Micro Devices">AMD</abbr> 
processors.  These allow certain types of operation on arrays of numbers to 
be handled by the <abbr title="central processing unit">CPU</abbr>'s internal 
vector pipeline.
</p>

<h2>Creating subroutine libraries</h2>
<p>
Most operating systems provide a facility for combining a set of object files 
into a library of pre-compiled functions and subroutines, which can be shared 
by many programs.  This is a very useful technique which avoids the need to 
attach copies of the source code for commonly-used functions and subroutines 
to every program.
</p>
<p>
Libraries are also the normal way to distribute collections of functions and 
subroutines that have been written by other programmers.  One example is the 
very large and comprehensive collection of numerical algorithms which has 
been created by the Numerical Algorithms Group.  This is a commercial product, 
and it is provided as a pre-compiled library.
</p>

<h2>What happens during linking?</h2>
<p>
The linker takes one or more object files, plus libraries, and combines 
them to create an executable file.
</p>
<p>
One of the most important tasks which the linker performs is to resolve 
references to functions and subroutines from different object files.  To 
understand this, consider a FORTRAN&nbsp;77 program which consists of two 
source code files.  The first file contains the main program, which calls a 
subroutine named <code>INVERT</code>.  That subroutine is defined in the 
second file.
</p>
<p>
When the compiler processes the first file, it finds a call to the 
<code>INVERT</code> subroutine, which it converts into the machine code 
instructions for a subroutine call.  However, it does not know the location 
for the machine code of the <code>INVERT</code> subroutine, so it cannot put 
the location in the object file.  Instead, it adds information to the object 
file to indicate that location of the <code>INVERT</code> is unknown and 
must be filled in by the linker.
</p>
<p>
When the compiler processes the second file, it adds information to that 
object file to indicate that it contains a subroutine named <code>INVERT</code>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, when the two object files are combined by the linker, the sections of 
machine code from each object file are copied into the executable file, and 
then the subroutine call instruction in the main program is updated with the 
location of the <code>INVERT</code> subroutine.
</p>
<p>
If the user forgets to include the second object file, then the linker has no 
information about a subroutine named <code>INVERT</code>, and it cannot create 
a valid executable file.  It will display an error message to tell the user 
that there is a call to an undefined subroutine.
