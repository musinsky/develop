<h1>The History of FORTRAN</h1>
<p>
FORTRAN was the world's first high-level programming language.  It was 
developed at 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> by a 
small team led by John Backus.  The earliest version of FORTRAN was released 
in 1957 as a programming tool for the 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>&nbsp;704.  
Fifty years later, FORTRAN remains the programming language of choice for 
large-scale numerical calculations in science and engineering.
</p>

<h2>Before FORTRAN</h2>
<p>
Programs for the earliest computers consisted of sequences of numerical codes. 
Each code represented a basic operation such as
'fetch a number from memory location X and put it in register A' 
or 'add the number in register A to the number in register B'.  
This style of programming was time-consuming and error-prone.  Mistakes were 
difficult to find.
</p>
<p>
By the time John Backus joined 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> as a 
scientific programmer in 1950, it had become possible to write programs 
using mnemomics such as <em>ADD</em> in place of the numerical codes.  A 
special program (which we would call an assembler today) converted the 
mnemonics into the corresponding numerical codes.  This made programming a 
little easier, but even a simple program required dozens of operations, and 
it was still difficult to track down mistakes.
</p>
<p>
Backus reasoned that it should be possible to create a programming language 
which allowed a series of calculations to be expressed in something resembling 
mathematical notation.  A translation program (a compiler, in today's 
terminology) would then convert it into the numerical codes which the computer 
understood.  Backus proposed this idea to his manager in 1953.  He was given a 
budget and encouraged to hire a small team to test the feasibility of the 
notion.
</p>
<p>
Three years later, the team published a manual which described the 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> 
Mathematical Formula Translating System, or FORTRAN for short.  Soon after, 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> made the 
first FORTRAN compiler available to users of the 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>&nbsp;704.
</p>
<p>
Backus and his team had created the world'd first high-level programming 
language.  Scientists and engineers would no longer have to write their 
programs as numerical codes or long-winded mnemonics.
</p>
<p>
Significantly, Backus's team had implemented the first 
<strong>optimizing</strong> compiler, which not only translated FORTRAN 
programs into the 
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr>&nbsp;704's 
numerical codes, but produced codes which ran very nearly as fast as anything 
that could be crafted by hand.
</p>
<p>
This was very important in ensuring the success of FORTRAN.  Early computers
were very slow by today's standards, and they represented an expensive 
commodity to their owners.  Inefficient programs wasted time and money.  
Backus and his team understood this, and they knew that they had to confound 
their critics who said that a program compiled from a high-level language 
could never be as efficient as one that was hand-crafted directly using 
numerical codes or mnemonics.
</p>

<h2>The Early Years</h2>
<p>
In 1958, <abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> 
released a revised version of the language, named FORTRAN&nbsp;II.  It 
provided support for procedural programming by introducing statements which 
allowed programmers to create subroutines and functions, thereby encouraging 
the re-use of code.
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN's growing popularity led many computer manufacturers to implement 
versions of it for their own machines.  Each manufacturer added its own 
customisations, making it impossible to guarantee that a program written for 
one type of machine would compile and run on a different type.  
<abbr title="International Business Machines Corporation">IBM</abbr> responded 
by removing all machine-dependent features from its version of the language.  
The result, released in 1961, was called FORTRAN&nbsp;IV.
</p>

<h2>FORTRAN&nbsp;66</h2>
<p>
By the early 1960s, there was growing pressure to create a standardised 
version of FORTRAN which was not tied to any single type of computer.  In 
1962, the <strong>American Standards Association</strong> (the precursor of 
<abbr title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</abbr>, the 
<strong>American National Standards Institute</strong>) convened a committee 
to pursue this goal.  The result, published in 1966, was a document which 
defined the language which became known as FORTRAN&nbsp;66.
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN&nbsp;66 marked a significant milestone in computer science.  It was 
the first programming language to be defined by a formal standard.
</p>

<h2>FORTRAN&nbsp;77</h2>
<p>
Within only a few years, the shortcomings of FORTRAN&nbsp;66 began to become 
apparent, especially by comparison with other programming languages such as C, 
Pascal and Algol.  Computer manufacturers again added customisations to the 
language to try to address some of these faults.
</p>
<p>
This forced the <abbr title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</abbr> 
FORTRAN standards committee, known as X3J3, to start work on a new version of 
the language in 1969.  The resulting standard would take eight years to reach 
maturity, but the language it defined, known as FORTRAN&nbsp;77, represented a 
major enhancement.  Among the features which it added were a true 
block&nbsp;<code>IF</code> statement, a <code>CHARACTER</code> data type, 
direct-access <abbr title="input/output">I/O</abbr> and the 
<code>PARAMETER</code> statement to define constants.
</p>
<p>
FORTRAN&nbsp;77 became the became the most widely-used version of the 
language, and it is likely that much of the legacy FORTRAN code around the 
world is written in this dialect of the language.
</p>

<h2>FORTRAN&nbsp;90</h2>
<p>
FORTRAN&nbsp;77 faced competition from languages such as C, which allowed 
programmers to allocate memory dynamically and to define heterogeneous data 
structures.  FORTRAN&nbsp;77 could do neither of these things.  The next 
version of FORTRAN to emerge from the 
<abbr title="American National Standards Institute">ANSI</abbr> X3J3 committee 
was designed to address these deficiencies.  It was tentatively named 
FORTRAN&nbsp;8X but by the late 1980s, the committee did not appear to be 
close to releasing the new standard, and there was a popular joke among 
computer scientists that 'X' would need to be a hexadecimal digit.
</p>
<p>
The new version of FORTRAN was finally published as a standard by the 
<strong>International Standards Organisation</strong> in 1991, and it became 
known informally as FORTRAN&nbsp;90.
